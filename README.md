# SGFPlayerClean

Native macOS SGF player with shared 2D/3D board state, OGS live play, and KataGo analysis.
The application project is `SGFPlayerClean/SGFPlayerClean.xcodeproj` and its scheme is `SGFPlayerClean`.
The older `davemarvit/SGFPlayer` repository is a separate implementation.

## Preserved baseline — October 14, 2026

GitHub `main` was at `c30c12e` when this review began. The local app had substantial uncommitted
changes, including KataGo integration, a new model, and two analysis views.

Those runtime changes and required resources are preserved in commit `4a290e4` on
[`codex/preserve-local-work-2026-10-14`](https://github.com/davemarvit/SGFPlayerClean/tree/codex/preserve-local-work-2026-10-14).
That snapshot built successfully before the connection refactor. It is a recovery point,
not a claim that live gameplay has passed acceptance testing.

A separately verified local archive includes the entire original working directory, Git history,
untracked files, logs, and local documentation. Its location is
`/Users/Dave/Documents/SGF PLayer/recovery/2026-10-14/SGFPlayerClean-before-refactor.tar.gz`.
The adjacent `backup-verification.json` records its SHA-256 and 994 verified files.
Logs, editor state, unrelated personal files, and duplicate assets were not added to the GitHub snapshot.

The original checkout at `/Users/Dave/SGFPlayerClean` remains on `main` with its pre-existing working changes.
Development is isolated in `/Users/Dave/Documents/SGF PLayer/SGFPlayerClean-review`.
Neither `main` nor the preservation branch should be used for ongoing refactoring.

## Networking architecture

`OGSClient` continues to own OGS message encoding, authentication flow, game rules, clocks,
and lobby policy. Socket lifecycle and HTTP reads delegate to independently testable components:

- `Services/Networking/OGSConnectionController.swift`: one connection attempt and receive loop,
  generation checks for stale callbacks, cancellable exponential retries (1–30 seconds), a
  15-second connection deadline, and WebSocket ping/pong liveness checks.
- `Services/Networking/OGSURLSessionSocket.swift`: the production URLSession adapter, including
  text/binary decoding and forwarding of close, receive, and send failures.
- `Services/Networking/OGSHTTPTransport.swift`: cancellable URLSession GET requests with
  main-queue completion and explicit HTTP status validation.
- `Services/Networking/OGSPaginatedReader.swift`: one complete lobby snapshot at a time,
  cancellation across every page, same-origin pagination limits, and cooldowns for HTTP 429/503.
- `Services/Networking/OGSJSONReader.swift`: latest-request-wins identity and game reads,
  completing cancelled callers once and discarding late responses.
- `Services/Networking/OGSSocketEvent.swift`: checked event-envelope decoding that preserves
  both array batches and dictionary updates without indexing a missing payload.

The controller serializes state and observer callbacks on the main queue. Intentional disconnect
cancels retry and heartbeat work. A new socket resets authentication/subscription/room flags so
the existing handshake can restore subscriptions. Send failures trigger recovery but never replay
game commands, whose server acceptance may be unknown. Authentication tokens are redacted from
outgoing diagnostic history.

A failed or malformed lobby page now discards the whole refresh; it cannot prune challenges
using a partial list. Polls cannot overlap, and a server `Retry-After` cooldown survives reconnects.
Lobby reads stop when entering a game or disconnecting. Replaced game reads and identity reads
cancel their previous tasks; logout also invalidates pending login/config responses. HTTP errors
cannot masquerade as successful JSON snapshots. Existing empty-lobby and 15-second grace-period
safeguards remain in place.

Queued socket updates carry connection/game generations, so they cannot restore authentication
after disconnect or apply scoring/clock data after changing games. Game packets are filtered
before updating the state-version counter. Challenge creation/acceptance validates HTTP status,
rejects overlapping POSTs, releases busy state on failure, and invalidates pending callbacks when
cancelled or disconnected. No mutation is automatically retried. Failed accepts only remove a
challenge on HTTP 404; cancellation, authentication errors, and timeouts leave the listing intact.
SGF downloads also validate HTTP status before passing bytes to the file loader.

The existing Socket.IO endpoint and outgoing game protocol are retained. Authentication
confirmation/ACK handling and full move/state-version reconciliation still need separate work.
Game notifications now carry connection/game context through AppModel and chat queues; stale
notifications are rejected at consumption, including after switching away and back to the same game. Local tests do not establish live
OGS login, challenge, or gameplay compatibility.

## End-of-game scoring and UI

Scoring consumes standalone phase events, full removal lists, removal/revival deltas, seki-mode
updates, and acceptance events. Accepting sends the current server-derived marks/seki mode and
shows a pending state until a matching confirmation arrives. Mark edits and resume requests also
wait for server updates; a 15-second timeout releases pending controls without replaying actions.
Disconnecting, switching games, changing marks, or changing seki mode invalidates acceptance.
Resume sends only `game/removed_stones/reject`; it no longer also requests an undo.

The client and board reject scoring edits for spectators, disconnected sessions, finished games,
and historical board positions. Finished snapshots preserve omitted marks while respecting an
explicit empty list. The shared scoring decoder is used for REST and socket game data before
move-version replay guards. `score_stones` is not interpreted as dead-stone coordinates.

The panel displays OGS-supplied totals and components (territory, stones, prisoners, komi,
handicap), without recalculating totals or inventing missing components. Valid server scoring
positions take precedence over the local overlay in both board views. The local flood fill is
only an estimate; it is not a complete Japanese/seki/rules-aware scoring engine. Manual neutral
point editing and a seki-mode toggle remain unimplemented; the server's seki mode is displayed
and preserved on acceptance. Historical boards omit end-position overlays, and candidate-move
hints are hidden during scoring. Dismissing the result overlay no longer destroys result state.
Spectator outcomes and draws are not presented as personal losses.

The protocol fixtures follow the [OGS real-time API](https://ogs.readme.io/docs/real-time-api)
and the official Goban client at commit `d7eb38eb4e9e1c48ace12befb98d9f3c821ec2f3`:
[server events](https://github.com/online-go/goban/blob/d7eb38eb4e9e1c48ace12befb98d9f3c821ec2f3/src/engine/protocol/ServerToClient.ts),
[scoring commands](https://github.com/online-go/goban/blob/d7eb38eb4e9e1c48ace12befb98d9f3c821ec2f3/src/Goban/OGSConnectivity.ts).
These are source/fixture checks, not live compatibility testing.

Render the actual SwiftUI component with sample states, without starting the app or contacting OGS:

```sh
python3 Tests/Preview/render_scoring.py /private/tmp/sgfplayer-scoring-preview.png
```

## Remaining investigation boundaries

- Authentication still infers readiness from several events, and ACK parsing/framing needs a
  dedicated protocol fixture before changing the established endpoint or login exchange.
- Move handling mixes move numbers and state versions and includes optimistic moves/passes.
  Changing that requires replay fixtures covering handicap, undo, reconnect, and scoring transitions.
- KataGo process callbacks are not tied to a process generation; a terminated older process can
  clear a replacement's state. Analysis responses are indexed by turn without matching their
  request/game identity, and cache work reads mutable state on background queues. These are
  substantive remaining risks. A fake subprocess/temporary-cache harness can validate a separate
  repair offline; no engine process or cache behavior is changed in this scoring pass.

## Local playback repairs

Local snapshots retain the viewed move index, initial player, state version, and capture counts.
Returning from online mode reconstructs that saved position and keeps the remaining moves
available for playback. Clearing the board clears the last-move/turn state. Negative setup
coordinates, group/territory positions, and playback indices are checked before array access.
These changes use the existing move/capture implementation; they do not change Go rules.

## Build and automated validation

Run from the repository root:

```sh
xcodebuild -project SGFPlayerClean/SGFPlayerClean.xcodeproj \
  -scheme SGFPlayerClean -configuration Debug \
  -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/SGFPlayerCleanReview build
swift test
python3 Tests/Integration/run_loopback.py
```

The root Swift package compiles the networking sources, OGSClient, shared models/settings,
playback engine, and chat view model used by Xcode. It is an offline test harness, not a replacement app target. The original local, untracked nested Swift package
was a Hello World executable and is not used here.

The 94 automated tests cover disconnect, failed receives/sends, retry cancellation and bounds,
stale callbacks, connection/heartbeat timeouts, observer reentrancy, complete pagination,
HTTP errors, rate-limit cooldowns, cancellation, event payload shapes, challenge failure/busy-state
handling, queued notification invalidation, scoring transitions/confirmation/timeout,
server score parsing, and local playback restoration/bounds. They use fake sockets,
a controllable scheduler, and URLProtocol HTTP fixtures. Client tests exercise the production
OGSClient with an ephemeral session and no shared cookies; every HTTP request is intercepted,
and socket creation is injected. No production OGS connection is made by these tests. The loopback test compiles the production WebSocket transport
and runs against a localhost-only Python standard-library fixture, exercising real text/binary
delivery, sending, abrupt connection loss, reconnect, ping/pong, and disconnect. Neither suite
uses OGS credentials or creates games.

Keep the draft isolated while collecting these repairs. One combined acceptance session before
merging or replacing the working app should verify local playback, login, challenge creation,
reconnection during an active game, and return to local mode in the built app. KataGo requires
an installed executable (default `/opt/homebrew/bin/katago`); its model is included in the preserved resources.

## Recovery without disturbing another checkout

Create a fresh checkout of the preservation branch:

```sh
git fetch origin
git worktree add ../SGFPlayerClean-preserved origin/codex/preserve-local-work-2026-10-14
```

Open its Xcode project to build the pre-refactor app. Keep the preservation branch and full local
archive until the refactored version has passed live acceptance testing.
