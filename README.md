# SGFPlayerClean

Native macOS SGF player with shared 2D/3D board state, OGS live play, and KataGo analysis.
The application project is `SGFPlayerClean/SGFPlayerClean.xcodeproj` and its scheme is `SGFPlayerClean`.
The older `davemarvit/SGFPlayer` repository is a separate implementation.

## Preserved baseline — October 14, 2026

GitHub `main` was at `c30c12e` when this review began. The local app had substantial uncommitted
changes, including KataGo integration, a new model, and two analysis views.

Those runtime changes and required resources are preserved in commit `4a290e4` on
[`codex/preserve-local-work-2026-10-14`](https://github.com/davemarvit/SGFPlayerClean/tree/codex/preserve-local-work-2026-10-14).
That snapshot built successfully before the connection refactor. It is a recovery point,
not a claim that live gameplay has passed acceptance testing.

A separately verified local archive includes the entire original working directory, Git history,
untracked files, logs, and local documentation. Its location is
`/Users/Dave/Documents/SGF PLayer/recovery/2026-10-14/SGFPlayerClean-before-refactor.tar.gz`.
The adjacent `backup-verification.json` records its SHA-256 and 994 verified files.
Logs, editor state, unrelated personal files, and duplicate assets were not added to the GitHub snapshot.

The original checkout at `/Users/Dave/SGFPlayerClean` remains on `main` with its pre-existing working changes.
Development is isolated in `/Users/Dave/Documents/SGF PLayer/SGFPlayerClean-review`.
Neither `main` nor the preservation branch should be used for ongoing refactoring.

## Connection architecture

`OGSClient` continues to own the existing OGS message encoding, authentication flow, game rules,
clocks, and lobby behavior. Its socket lifecycle now delegates to:

- `Services/Networking/OGSConnectionController.swift`: one connection attempt and receive loop,
  generation checks for stale callbacks, cancellable exponential retries (1–30 seconds), a
  15-second connection deadline, and WebSocket ping/pong liveness checks.
- `Services/Networking/OGSURLSessionSocket.swift`: the production URLSession adapter, including
  text/binary decoding and forwarding of close, receive, and send failures.

The controller serializes state and observer callbacks on the main queue. Intentional disconnect
cancels retry and heartbeat work. A new socket resets authentication/subscription/room flags so
the existing handshake can restore subscriptions. Send failures trigger recovery but never replay
game commands, whose server acceptance may be unknown. Authentication tokens are redacted from
outgoing diagnostic history.

The existing Socket.IO endpoint and game protocol are retained in this first extraction.
Authentication confirmation/ACK handling and REST request coordination still need a separate,
fixture-backed review before changing their behavior. Local loopback testing does not establish
live OGS login, challenge, or gameplay compatibility.

## Build and automated validation

Run from the repository root:

```sh
xcodebuild -project SGFPlayerClean/SGFPlayerClean.xcodeproj \
  -scheme SGFPlayerClean -configuration Debug \
  -derivedDataPath /private/tmp/SGFPlayerCleanReview build
swift test
python3 Tests/Integration/run_loopback.py
```

The root Swift package compiles the same networking sources used by Xcode. It is a networking
test harness, not a replacement app target. The original local, untracked nested Swift package
was a Hello World executable and is not used here.

The deterministic tests use fake sockets and a controllable scheduler. They cover disconnect,
failed receives/sends, retry cancellation and bounds, stale callbacks, connection/heartbeat
timeouts, observer reentrancy, and main-queue delivery. The loopback test compiles the production
transport and runs against a localhost-only Python standard-library WebSocket fixture, exercising
real text/binary delivery, sending, abrupt connection loss, reconnect, ping/pong, and disconnect.
Neither test suite uses OGS credentials or creates games.

Before merging or replacing the working app, verify local playback, login, challenge creation,
reconnection during an active game, and return to local mode in the built app. KataGo requires
an installed executable (default `/opt/homebrew/bin/katago`); its model is included in the preserved resources.

## Recovery without disturbing another checkout

Create a fresh checkout of the preservation branch:

```sh
git fetch origin
git worktree add ../SGFPlayerClean-preserved origin/codex/preserve-local-work-2026-10-14
```

Open its Xcode project to build the pre-refactor app. Keep the preservation branch and full local
archive until the refactored version has passed live acceptance testing.
